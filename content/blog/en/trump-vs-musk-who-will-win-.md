# Trump vs Musk : who will win ?

The Trump vs Musk was has started. This 6th of June 2025, after a powerful ride together, the divorce between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has started. And it will be as bloody as their association was romantic.

## How it started

It's a long story short. Elon Musk has been very angry against the democrats as the party has been phagocytosed by the left wing overtime : starting with Bernie Sanders the 2016 primaries, continuing with AOC (Alexandria Ocasio Cortez), Elisabeth Waren or.. Kamala Haris more recently. The democrat party became "woke", intolerant, praising positive discrimations (meaning discriminations). Elon admitted in an interview lately than he's been very affected that his former son Xavier has "transitioned" into a girl, Vivian. In addition to the party's wokism, the Biden administration has been overspending and the US debt exploded after the covid and never went down.

## The Biden administration's mandate review

The Biden administration did not deliver any promise : 
- It started with a scandal over Hunter Biden's laptop, censured by Twitter. They also censured the President Trump's account while he was still the president. Furthermore, there have been strong suspicions of electoral fraud. Elon always supported free speech, as it's the USA constitution first amendement.
- Elon has been forced to be vaccinated against the covid after a massive mediatic campaign and a repressive state policy. He admitted being injured by the recently developped vaccine that should have been "safe and effective". He was also very critical about the lies around the covid scandal, especially because the experts and politicians said the vaccine would block transmission or that the covid was coming from a pangolin and not the Wuhan P4 lab.
- The Biden administration left Afghanistan to the taliban's hands, leaving huge military equipements behind them.
- Russia invaded Ukraine. Musk did provide Starlink technology to ukrainian military, allowing them to resist after russian's strikes against ukrainian telecommunication infrastructure. He did support Ukraine self-defense, but also promoted peace and life saving. The USA did induce this conflict as the CIA did a coup in 2014 to remove a pro-russian president for a pro-NATO. Zbigniew Brzezi≈Ñski, a former diplomatic advisor of President Carter and President Obama, revealled that taking away Ukraine from Russia was a US diplomatic top priority since the cold war ended. This is why they kept pushing for Ukraine to join NATO, which is a Russia red line.
- The Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel has been then bombing the Palestinians, including civilians.

## The tight relationship between the Biden administration and Elon Musk

Elon Musk freedom of speech went against the democrats censorship mandates. He intended to buy Twitter and "free the bird" with a free speech policy. The Biden administration did not like it. Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley gourou, admitted in a Joe Rogan podcast that the Biden administration also wanted to control closely the AI development. As the relationship between Musk and the democrats was deteriorating, Biden decided to invite all the US EV constructors to the White House, except Tesla. Elon Musk saw this as a new provocation against him. He considers he doesn't have enough gratitude from the public authorities, as he's the biggest tax payer in the US history.

## The switch to Trump

After Elon Musk bought Twitter, he leaked the Twitter Files proving the Biden administration officials asked for content suppresion. He slowly started to promote conservative or libertarian repulican figures like Ron De Santis or Vivek Ramaswamy. He then went ALL-IN into the Trump campaign after he was shot during a rally, emphasizing on his courage after the former President standed and shouted "Fight, fight, fight". After that event, he campaigned against the democrats, saying it could be the last election the US would know as there is no voter ID in several swing states and thanks to an uncontrolled immigration, it could go blue forever. He created a lobby promoting free speech and giving $1M randomnly to someone than signed the petition, every day. He's personnaly spent a lot in the campaign, but he knew he could win big in SpaceX contracts with the next Trump administration. Before supporting Trump, he also negociated to cut in the US expenses to reduce the national debt. He's been appointed to DOGE after Trump get elected.

## The divorce

Trump backed a budget bill call "BBB" for "Big Beautiful Bill". It's the more overspending budget in US history. Elon Musk considered it was a betrayal, canceling his DOGE work (that move him away from Tesla or SpaceX for a period of time). It's the exact opposite than what Trump was elected for and what Musk did agree on.

## Now, who will will ?

Every time Elon Musk is in trouble, I always remember those words from Peter Thiel : never bet again Elon. Of course, Trump's resilience is impressive. He came back from nowhere, has been jailed, nearly got assassinated yet he won one of the largest electoral victory. But Elon has a lot of influence in the libertarian movement, especially in the Silicon Valley. He kicked the war on his social network X, accusing Trump of being one of the Epstein's client. He accused the President that he didn't release the Esptein files because he was himself on the list.

## Why Musk is so dangerous for Trump ?

Because despite he has everything to lose, he simply doesn't care. He said during an interview : "give me money, give me power, I don't care". He proved that money and power were actually not what he was primalary searching for. He put himself at risk, first against the Biden administration, now against the Trump one. His political positions have made him lost billion of dollars on Tesla stocks. Trump just said he's gonna cancel SpaceX contracts. He's about to lose everything, yet he stays firmly on his positions. Elon Musk belives in truth, and he's achieved enough to run after money or power. Trump should too, as he's old, in his last mandate and has a strong legitimacy from the election, yet he just betrayed his promises for some reason I purely ignore.

## Conclusion

Let's see how it goes, and if Trump can go back but the divorce seems deep now. Elon Musk has probably been the most threatened person on earth, making himself enemies like Putin, Biden and now Trump. But he stays strong on his feet.
